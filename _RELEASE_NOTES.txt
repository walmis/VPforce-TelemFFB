- **"Run Anything"**
 - New feature that will allow you to kick off any shell command when an aircraft loads (or SIM or Aircraft Category).

## MSFS:
- **Dynamic SimConnect Subscriptions**
 - Some 3rd party aircraft use alternate "L:Vars" for certain pieces of data that various effects use.  This renders the applicable effects either inoperable or inaccurate.
 - This new functionality allows us to dynamically replace a given piece of telemetry with the L:var that is needed to retrieve the applicable data from a given aircraft.
 - The only *known* aircraft today are the A2A Comanche and the B206/B47 from FlyInside.  These simconnect re-subscriptions are baked into this release, however this new feature will allow us to accommodate more aircraft in the future without the need to modify the underlying effects code.
- **[HPG Helicopters] - Trim Release Damper for the Collective Axis**
 - Similar to the Cyclic trim release damper setting that was in the previous release, this adds the same concept for the HPG collective axis when the TR button is depressed.
## DCS:
- **New, more accurate Airspeed Telemetry**
 - It was recently discovered that both the 'TAS' and 'IAS' data that comes directly from the sim is inaccurate in several ways.  The 'TAS' data seems to be more in line with ground speed.  Th "IAS" data, while more accurate, seems to include a fixed value, regardless of heading, that is somewhere around 2x the current wind speed.
   - Given the above inaccuracies, with most effects leveraging the 'TAS' data, you may have noticed odd behavior of effects like ETL.
   - In this version, we are calculating the "true" TAS by using the aircraft velocity vectors and the wind vectors to determine the aircraft's actual speed through the air mass.  This has given us a much more accurate data set than was previously available from the sim.
- **Helicopter Trim Release Damper**
 - This is **not** a replacement of the in-game trim release functionality.  It is a simple spring based dampening effect, identical to the one for MSFS.
 - To configure, simply enable the effect and bind the same button that you have configured for TR in the sim.  While the button is depressed, TelemFFB will add the dampening effect and will remove it when the button is released.  The actual trimming and centering offset is still completely handled by DCS.
## IL-2:
- **Improved effects handling when game window loses focus**
 - IL-2 does some strange things, including a "kill all" when the window loses focus.  This update improves on the TelemFFB handling of this scenario

## Fixes:
- ALL | Helicopter Overspeed shake was missing from settings UI
- IL2 | Increased intensity setting range and boosted read values for buffeting "Shaker" effect
- DCS | Fixed F/A-18 flaps deployment causing pedal trim offset
- MSFS | Fixed axis snapping to 0,0 during cyclic position initialization after un-pausing
## Enhancements:
- MSFS | Disable individual device axis sending when global "Axis Control" is enabled for MSFS
- MSFS | Add "Don't Send" option in custom simvar config for axis control in MSFS
- MSFS/X-Plane | Configurable dampening force when force trim release button is held
- IL2 | Dynamic pedal forces now supported
## New Effects:
- **Generic 'Stick Shaker' effect** (MSFS)
- ***Beta*** **Pedal AFCS integration for HPG H145/H160**
 - Requires latest dev builds from the HPG discord
- ***Experimental*** **VRS effect for helicopters**
 - Define the airspeed threshold below which VRS can occur
 - Define the "onset" and "full" vertical descent rates where VRS will occur if under the airspeed threshold
 - Define the max intensity of the rumble effect.  Effect will start low at the onset v/s rate and linearly increase in intensity up to max at the "full" v/s rate
- **Configurable damper/friction/inertia effect override sliders**
 - Ability to enable and configure damper/friction/inertia for any given aircraft profile.  Sliders max is bound by active configurator profile settings
- ***Experimental*** **Low Hydraulics effect**
 - In concert with the above damper/friction/inertia overrides, you can define heavier settings to emulate low or loss of hydraulic pressure
 - See sections the manual for details..  ***seriously***... you need to RTFM before you play with this effect
 - Supported Sims/Aircraft:
   - MSFS - TelemFFB reads the "Hydraulic System" simvar, so theoretically any aircraft where that data is representative of a low/failure condition is supported.
   - DCS - Unique pressure gauge and/or warning light data must be tracked on a per-aircraft basis.  Limited aircraft are supported currently
     - Supported:
       - UH-1, SA342, Mi-8, Mi-24, KA-50
       - A-10C, AV-8B, F-14, F15ESE
## New App Features:
- **Startup/Shutdown Configurator Profiles**
 - Ability to select configurator profiles that will load when TelemFFB starts or exits (Configured in the system settings dialog)
- **Configurator Profile compatibility checking**
 - Validates the PID for the chosen profile matches the device you are selecting it for.  Validation is done when selecting profile and at time of push

# General
- New integrated updater app!
 - Upon startup, TelemFFB will check for available updates and, if available, prompt you to download and install.  If you proceed, TelemFFB will quit and the updater app will launch and allow you to install the update with the push of a button
    - You may optionally restart TelemFFB automatically when the update is complete
 - If you canceled the update, you can also update from the Utilities menu, or you will be prompted again the next time TelemFFB starts
 - If you find the popup annoying and *dont* want to update, you may disable the auto update prompt in your user config file by setting `ignore_auto_updates=True`
    - If you have disabled the update notifications, you may still update via the Utilities Menu
 - **Caution** - The update process will ***overwrite*** config.ini!  If you are not yet making use of a user config file, now would be a good time to start.

#General
- Added menu option to force an effects reset.  This can be useful if an effect gets stuck for some reason (sim crash for example) as an alternative to starting TelemFFB with the -r (reset) flag.  Use with caution in DCS and IL-2 as it is destructuve to any effects generated by the sim itself.

#MSFS
- **Cyclic hat-trim following for generic helicopters**
 - Follows the same setup as the trim following for fixed wing aircraft
 - Read this section in the manual for a refresher: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YL5DLkiTxlaNx_zKHEYSs25PjmGtQ6_WZDk58_SGt8Y/edit#heading=h.gebv2sue64zj

#DCS
As more people have started building DIY pedals, there are some enhancements to the handling of FFB pedals in DCS with this release of TelemFFB.
Please read this section of the manual the detailed documentation which also links to a separate section of the document for tips on setting
up DCS to avoid getting trim events meant for your joystick sent to your pedals:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YL5DLkiTxlaNx_zKHEYSs25PjmGtQ6_WZDk58_SGt8Y/edit#heading=h.bamrt98l8wd5
_ _
New pedal features for DCS:
- **Rudder trim for fixed wing aircraft**
- **Auto spring mode switching for Heli/Jet/Prop aircraft types (or per aircraft)**

Default Behavior is as follows:
- 'JetAircraft'
 - Pedal trimming enabled
 - Spring mode = Static
   - Static spring based on configurable spring and dampening gain

- 'PropellerAircraft'
 - Pedal trimming enabled
 - Spring mode = Dynamic
   - Dynamic force based on configurable spring and dampening gain.  Force will be applied linearly with 0 at rest, %25 at the published Vs speed and %100 at the published Vne speed.
   - In an effort to keep as much complexity out of the config as possible, these Vs and Vne values are currently hard coded for the DCS warbirds, but instructions exist in the manual for overriding or for setting up a different aircraft to use dynamic pedal forces.

- 'Helicopter'
 - Pedal trimming not supported (sorry,  I tried multiple ways but DCS is too broken in this regard for helicopters that even have pedal trimming)
 - Spring mode = Disabled
    - Configurable dampening gain is available

############################################
##  November 8, 2023
############################################
#MSFS
- Add setting `center_spring_on_pause` to center with springs during pause/slew conditions
 - If true the stick will center with spring force when the simulator enters pause or slew
- TelemFFB will now auto-detect the aircraft category and engine type for all aircraft and load the appropriate default settings if no aircraft specific entry is found
 - Still possible for data from simconnect to be inaccurate
- Added engine/prop and jet (turbine) rumble effects to 'TurbopropAircraft' type
- Fixed jet engine rumble not playing for JetAircraft type

##  November 6, 2023
#############################################
#DCS
- Extended the damage effect to support all FC3 aircraft
- Add setting to enable disable basic AoA forces effect `aoa_effect_enabled` (default=yes)

#MSFS
- Added VRS effect to HPG Helicopter class
    - new setting `vrs_effect_intensity` (%0-100, default %20)
    - will lightly shudder when on verge of VRS conditions, medium shudder when slightly into VRS, maximum shudder when VRS fully developed
- Fixed config.ini so gear/flaps/spoiler(speedbrake) effects are in the default configuration for MSFS aircraft
- Toned down the dynamic force effect on rudder pedals in non-FBW fixed wing aircraft.

#MSFS
- Hot patch for HPG H145/H160 implementation which greatly improves the hands on detection
 - There is a new `hands_off_deadzone` setting that will dictate when TelemFFB will notify the helicopter that spring override is no longer active
 - previously the hands on/hands off point was a single deadzone around the center of the stick
 - now a smaller "hands off deadzone" will prevent flapping of hands on detection as the stick will need to be much closer to center to trigger "hands off" than it did to trigger "hands on"

############################################
##  October 31, 2023
#############################################

#MSFS
- New special integration with the Hype Performance Group Airbus H145 and H160 Helicopters
 - Full FFB integration with the AFCS for both the Cyclic and Collective axes (Tail rotor axis is planned)
 - Tight integration with the AFCS data provides a true-to-life experience with the Rhino
 - This was a 2-sided project with support from HPG to add necessary capabilities for TelemFFB to communicate the state of the axes for proper implementation!
 - Requires a minimum of Build 43 Patch 2 for the H160 and Build420 Patch 3 for the H145.  These patches are available in the HPG Discord.
- For a full breakdown of the capabilities and tips on setup, check out the VPforce user guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YL5DLkiTxlaNx_zKHEYSs25PjmGtQ6_WZDk58_SGt8Y/edit#heading=h.f30c77lc61iq
- NOTE:  If you are running from python source instead of the exe release file, we have switched to a forked version of pysimconenct to support reading/writing of L:VARS in MSFS.  As such, you will need to `pip uninstall pysimconnect` and then re-run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
